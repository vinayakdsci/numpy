``ma.corrcoef`` may return a slightly different result
------------------------------------------------------
A pairwise observation approach is currently used in `ma.corrcoef` to 
calculate the standard deviations for each pair of variables. This has been 
changed as it is being used to normalise the covariance, estimated using 
`ma.cov`, which does not consider the observations for each variable in a 
pairwise manner, rendering it unnecessary. The normalisation has been 
replaced by the more appropriate standard deviation for each variable, 
which significantly reduces the wall time, but will return slightly different 
estimates of the correlation coefficients in cases where the observations 
between a pair of variables are not aligned. However, it will return the same 
estimates in all other cases, including returning the same correlation matrix 
as `corrcoef` when using a masked array with no masked values.
