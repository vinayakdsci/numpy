`lapack_lite` is now thread safe
--------------------------------

NumPy provides a minimal low-performance version of LAPACK named ``lapack_lite``
that can be used if no BLAS/LAPACK system is detected at build time.

Until now, ``lapack_lite`` was not thread safe. Single-threaded use cases did
not hit any issues, but running linear algebra operations in multiple threads
could lead to errors, incorrect results, or seg faults due to data races.

We have added a global lock, serializing access to ``lapack_lite`` in multiple
threads.
